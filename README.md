# Maze generator and solver
Python scripts for generating random solvable mazes using the depth-first search and recursive backtracking algorithms. The code also implements a recursive backtracking pathfinding algorithm for solving the generated mazes. Here is an example of a generated maze and its computed solution.

Both the generator and solver algorithm uses recursive backtracking and here an example of the latter can be seen. Cells indicated in light orange are part of the backtracking.
